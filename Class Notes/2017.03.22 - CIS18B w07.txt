			REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
00:13:00	What is a regular Expression
			http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html
			
				Examples
					"Hello, this is text"
					
00:18:00			"This\s+is\s+text"

			Regex					Matches
			this is text			Matches exactly "this is text"
			this\s+is\s+text		Matches the word "this" followed by one or more whitespace characters
									followed by the word "is" followed by one or more whitespace characters
									followed by the word "text".
			^\d+(\.\d+)?			^ defines that the patter must start at beginning of a new line. 
									\d+ matches one or several digits. 
									The ? makes the statement in brackets optional. 
									\. matches ".", parentheses are used for grouping. 
									Matches for example "5", "1.5" and "2.21".

		Common Matching Symbols
		.			Matches any character
		^regex		Finds regex that must match at the beginning of the line.
		regex$		Finds regex that must match at the end of the line.
		[abc]		Set definition, can match the letter a or b or c.
		[abc][vz]	Set definition, can match a or b or c followed by either v or z.
		[^abc]		When a caret appears as the first character inside square brackets, it negates the pattern. This pattern matches any character except a or b or c.
		[a-d1-7]	Ranges: matches a letter between a and d and figures from 1 to 7, but not d1.
		X|Z			Finds X or Z.
		XZ			Finds X directly followed by Z.
		$			Checks if a line end follows.

00:25:32	META CHARACTERS
			Regular Expression	Description
			\d			Any digit, short for [0-9]
			\D			A non-digit, short for [^0-9]
			\s			A whitespace character, short for [ \t\n\x0b\r\f]
			\S			A non-whitespace character, short for
			\w			A word character, short for [a-zA-Z_0-9]
			\W			A non-word character [^\w]
			\S+			Several non-whitespace characters
			\b			Matches a word boundary where a word character is [a-zA-Z0-9_]


			\d		--->	Any Didgit [0-9]
			\D		--->	not any Digit [^0-9]		
			\s		--->	ws	[\t\n\x0b]			//11 in decimal
			
			
			
00:32:00	Quantifier

			Regular Expression	Description											Examples
			*					Occurs zero or more times, is short for {0,}		X* finds no or several letter X, <sbr /> .* finds any character sequence
			+					Occurs one or more times, is short for {1,}			X+- Finds one or several letter X
			?					Occurs no or one times, ? is short for {0,1}.		X? finds no or exactly one letter X
			{X}					Occurs X number of times, {} describes the order	\d{3} searches for three digits, .{10} for any character sequence of length 10.
								of the preceding liberal
			{X,Y}				Occurs between X and Y times,						\d{1,4} means \d must occur at least once and at a maximum of four.
			*?					? after a quantifier makes it a reluctant 
								quantifier. It tries to find the smallest 
								match. This makes the regular expression 
								stop at the first match.
